        <p> Hello, my name is Parker Hirschi, and I am a student at Brigham Young University – Pathway
            Worldwide. I have
            a love for both technology and creativity, which inspires me in my studies and hobbies.
            I enjoy watching movies—especially ones that make me think or spark new ideas. Movies have always
            been a way
            for me to relax and also learn from different perspectives. Alongside that, I spend a lot of my free
            time
            coding in
            Python. I like challenging myself to build small projects, test out new tools, and see what I can
            create.
            I also enjoy learning about new technologies and experimenting with them, whether it’s artificial
            intelligence, machine learning, or just exploring the latest trends in tech. My curiosity keeps me
            motivated
            to grow and improve.
            Outside of school and hobbies, I’m happily married—I got married in 2024 and recently celebrated my
            first
            anniversary. Family is a huge part of my life and keeps me grounded.
            Looking ahead, my big goal is to become an AI/ML Engineer. I want to work on projects that make a
            real
            difference in people’s lives and contribute to the future of technology.
            In everything I do, I try to keep learning, stay curious, and enjoy the journey.

            North Carolina is a state with a lot of beauty. There are gardens everywhere and many trails
            to hike. The
            beaches are also very beautiful and clean, making it a great place to visit.
